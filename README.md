*(Final Project – Data Analyst)*

## 🎯 Project Overview
Performed RFM-based customer segmentation on e-commerce sales data to understand purchasing behavior and profitability.  
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize customer groups, product performance, and regional trends.

## ⚙️ Steps Taken
1. Cleaned and preprocessed data using Python (handled nulls, duplicates, and data types).  
2. Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI.  
3. Created RFM columns and customer segmentation logic using DAX formulas.  
4. Designed a Power BI dashboard to visualize segmentation, sales, and profit trends.  
5. Derived actionable business insights and recommendations.

## 📊 Key Findings
