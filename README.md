*(Final Project – Data Analyst)*

## 🎯 Project Overview
Performed RFM-based customer segmentation on e-commerce sales data to understand purchasing behavior and profitability.  
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize customer groups, product performance, and regional trends.

## ⚙️ Steps Taken
1. Collected and cleaned 51,290 transaction records from the Kaggle dataset. 
2. Performed RFM analysis in Python.  
3. Segmented customers into 9 behavioral groups (e.g., *Champions*, *Loyal*, *At Risk*, *Hibernating*).  
4. Designed a Power BI dashboard to visualize segmentation, sales, and profit trends.  
5. Derived actionable business insights and recommendations.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Loyal Customers (37.9%) and Champions (19.3%) are the most profitable and active segments.  
- Technology category generates the highest revenue and profit (~$40M).  
- Profit decreases as shipping costs increase, especially above 10,000.  
- Discounts remain effective for top customer segments.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Retain **Loyal** and **Champion** customers with loyalty programs.  
- Reactivate **At Risk** and **Hibernating** segments through targeted campaigns.  
- Focus marketing on **Technology** category for higher profitability.  
- Optimize discount and shipping cost strategies.
